- 👋 Hi, I’m @briangrafix
- 👀 I’m interested in building mobile web applications. I have experience building single page, single download applications that work just like an app. 
      In other words, the footer and the header never change, only the content in the middle
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, PHP, and the building of libraries.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything.
- 📫 How to reach me brian.grafixforu@gmail.com
